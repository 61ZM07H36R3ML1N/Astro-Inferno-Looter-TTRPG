To create a narrative script for your **Astro Inferno** session, I’ve analyzed your "Soul-Forge Awakening Script" and the core themes of the game found in your Google Drive. This script is designed for a **Session 0/1 transition**, moving players from character creation into their first "shooter-looter" style combat encounter.

# **🌑 ASTRO INFERNO: Narrative GM Script**

**Mission 01: The Soul-Forge Breach**

---

### **I. Session 0 Intro: The Dying Light**

*Read this to set the scene as players finalize their sheets.*

"The stars are no longer celestial bodies; they are flickering torches in a hallway that is getting longer and darker. You are currently aboard the *Icarus-9*, a scrap-metal freighter drifting through the **Bleed**.

The air is thick with the smell of burnt copper and stale oxygen. In this world, your life is measured by your **Aether Economy**—how much of your soul you are willing to burn to keep your gear running. You aren't heroes of legend; you are survivors of the void, clutching onto 'Soul-Tech' weapons that whisper secrets into your mind every time you pull the trigger."

### **II. Character Intros: The Awakening**

*Read these as the players 'log in' or initialize their characters in your app.*

* **For THE SATANIC COURT:** "The interface flickers red. As you touch the glass, the Machine recognizes your **Blood Tithe**. Your history is no longer a memory; it is a debt. Your blades feel heavier, hungrier. **GM Note:** Remind them their melee damage is up, but their Jam Risk is now 10% higher."  
* **For THE ANCIENTS:** "The echoes of the Void-Walker respond to your touch. Your soul is a relic of a dead star. You see the tactical openings in the air before they happen, but you feel your sanity slipping away like sand. **GM Note:** Their Critical Range is expanded, but warn them of the Aura Drain penalty."  
* **For GENESIS MACHINE:** "Calibration complete. You are a precision tool in a world of scrap. Your math is perfect, but perfection generates heat. If you push too hard, you will melt. **GM Note:** Grant them their Accuracy bonus, but track their Overheat Risk closely."  
* **For SECULAR (The Vault Survivor):** "No divine signature found. You are a ghost in the system, surviving on grit and scavenged luck. Your gear is broken, just like the world. **GM Note:** Boost their Scavenge Luck, but tag their gear as 'Fragile'."

### **III. The Narrative Hook (The Choice)**

*The ship’s alarm blares—a wet, metallic screaming sound.*

"The bulkhead at the end of the hall buckled. A group of **Void-Husks**—scavengers who lost their souls to the Machine—are trying to breach the reactor core. You have seconds to react."

**The Choice (Shooter-Looter Style):**

1. **Aggressive Breach:** Charge the hall. *Outcome:* High loot potential from the Husks, but high risk of taking 'Armor Decay' damage early.  
2. **Siphon the Core:** Use your Soul-Tech to overcharge the door's security. *Outcome:* Safer, but it costs 5 Essence/Soul Shards, and you might burn out your primary weapon's battery.  
3. **The Scavenger’s Path:** Vent the atmosphere in the side-hall to trap them. *Outcome:* Requires a high Tech-Check. If successful, you find a 'Rare Essence Core' in the debris. If you fail, you lose 10% of your current Oxygen.

### **IV. Scripted Outcomes**

* **If they win the combat:** "The last Husk falls, its body dissolving into black static. You stand over the pile of scrap. A faint blue glow emanates from a fallen chest—loot is yours for the taking, but the **Entropy** of the ship has just increased."  
* **If they flee:** "You seal the door, but the scratching on the other side doesn't stop. You’ve saved your lives, but you’ve lost the sector's resources. The dark just got a little bit hungrier."

### **Next Step for Development**

Since we have these outcomes, would you like me to write the **React component code** to handle these choices (e.g., a "Choice Card" that updates the player's Aether Economy or Jam Risk in real-time)?
