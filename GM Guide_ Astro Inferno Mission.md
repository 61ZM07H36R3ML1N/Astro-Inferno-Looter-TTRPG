Since this is your first time, I’ve designed this script to act as a **teleprompter**. I’ve included **Environmental Cues** (what to tell the players they see/smell), **Mechanical Prompts** (when to tell players to roll), and **CuJo Interjections** (tactical/snarky flavor).

**Setup:** \* **GM1 (The World):** You describe the horror, the NPCs, and the "feel" of the ship.

* **GM2 (The System):** You handle the map, the stats, and the dice results.  
* **CuJo (The UI):** Either GM can read CuJo, but use a "robotic/glitched" voice.

**🌑 ASTRO INFERNO: MISSION 01 \- THE SOUL-FORGE BREACH**

## **ACT 1: THE NEURALINK INITIALIZATION (Session 0 Intro)**

*Goal: Establish the tone and introduce the Player Assistant, CuJo.*

Implementing the atmospheric descriptions and technical integration we discussed, here is the rewritten opening sequence for **Astro Inferno**:

**GM1 (The World):** "Everyone, close your eyes. Imagine the sound of a heartbeat—not yours, but the ship’s. It’s a rhythmic, wet thumping echoing through the bulkheads, as if the metal itself has developed a pulse. You are drifting in the *Bleed*, where space isn't black, but a bruised, swirling purple-and-red nebula that feels like it's pressing against the hull. The air inside your pods smells like burnt hair and old ozone—the scent of the Soul-Tech active-cooling systems struggling to keep your physical bodies from cooking while your consciousness was archived."

**GM2 (The System):** "Players, your HUDs are flickering to life. I’m triggering the NEURALINK\_SYNC protocol now. Watch your screens—GM1, let CuJo take over the initialization."

**CuJo (The UI):** *(Voice glitched and robotic)* "Morning, Meat-Bags\! Or is it evening? Time is a bit subjective when your sun was harvested for parts three centuries ago. I am *CuJo*, your Combat Utility Overlay. I’ve just finished bypass-loading your fear responses to ensure peak performance. If you feel a sharp tingling in your spine, that’s just the Neuralink soldering itself to your soul. Don't worry, your Soul Integrity is still at a respectable $88\\%$. You're welcome\!"

**GM1 (The World):** "The pod glass frosts over, and you see your reflection—pale, tired, and marked by pulsing copper filigree of your 'Soul-Tech' implants that glow with a faint, uneasy light. One by one, describe what your character looks like as the pod door hisses open, the freezing air hits your skin, and the first thing you feel is the hum of the interface itching beneath your flesh. What was the last memory the Neuralink tried to 'archive' before you woke up?"

Integrating the bio-mechanical horror and the glitchy technical aesthetic we've established, here is the expanded version of [Act 2: The Hull Breach](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10tHyHtLQEym2mAAfkWo-YvmvzEdtQwxisCi1xiLpaxs/edit?tab=t.0).

### **ACT 2: THE HULL BREACH (The First Encounter)**

**GM1 (The World)**: "Suddenly, the floor lurches with a sickening, wet crunch. A sound like a lightning strike—jagged and deafening—tears through the deck. A massive obsidian spike, a *Void-Anchor*, punches through the bulkhead just ten feet away. It’s not just stone; it’s pulsing with a cold, violet light that seems to 'eat' the local gravity. The room’s atmosphere begins to scream as pressure drops, pulling loose scrap and frozen condensation toward the jagged breach in a violent, swirling vortex."

**GM2 (The System):** "The ship's internal sensors are flatlining in this sector. I’m updating your tactical maps now—you'll see the depressurization zones marked in red. Movement through these tiles will require an Athletics check to resist the vacuum pull. As the dust clears, three silhouettes emerge. GM1, show them what’s coming through the hole."

**GM1 (The World):** "Three *Void-Husks* haul themselves through the breach, their movements twitchy and unnatural. They look like humans sculpted from cracked, yellowing porcelain, with thick black sludge—*Void-Rot*—leaking from their joints and sizzling against the deck plates. The lead Husk snaps its head toward you with a bone-cracking jolt. Its eyes aren't eyes; they are twin pits of flickering blue 'Soul-Fire' that suck the light out of the room, leaving only shadows. It unhinges its jaw and lets out a scream that sounds like a dial-up modem dying in a meat grinder. It doesn't just see you; it hungers for the Aether in your veins."

**CuJo (The UI):** "Scanning... scanning... Oh, look\! New friends. And by 'friends,' I mean shambling vectors for necrotic infection. Visualizing weak points now—try to aim for the cracks in their 'skin' where the Soul-Fire is brightest. My calculations suggest a $74\\%$ chance you'll accidentally shoot each other instead, but hey, I like surprises. Suggestion: Use your weapons to create more holes in them than they currently have."

**GM2 (The System):** "Initiative protocol engaged. I’ve pushed the turn order to your HUDs. The Husks are sitting at a static 12—if you can beat that, you move before the Void-Rot reaches your position. Who's first?"

**ACT 3: THE LOOT & THE TRAP (The Shooter-Looter Loop)**

*Goal: Introduce loot and the "High Risk / High Reward" mechanic.*

ntegrating the gritty, bio-mechanical atmosphere and the glitchy technical aesthetic of **Astro Inferno**, here is the expanded version of [Act 3: The Loot & The Trap](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10tHyHtLQEym2mAAfkWo-YvmvzEdtQwxisCi1xiLpaxs/edit?tab=t.0).

### **ACT 3: THE LOOT & THE TRAP (The Shooter-Looter Loop)**

**GM1 (The World):** "The combat ends with a final, wet hiss. The Husks don't just die; they dissolve, their porcelain skin crumbling into piles of oily black ash and twitching, rusted metal. In the center of the scrap, a small canister is pulsing with a violent, rhythmic purple light. It’s a **Vile Essence Core**—a rare weapon mod that seems to be 'bleeding' violet radiation into the floorboards, causing the metal to warp and frost over."

**GM2 (The System):** "Tactical alert: I’ve highlighted the object on your HUDs. If you choose to slot this into your primary weapon, you’ll gain a \+1d6 **Necrotic Damage** bonus. However, the casing is cracked—it’s 'Leaking.' GM1, describe the localized distortion."

**GM1 (The World):** "As you step toward the core, the physics of the room begin to fail. The shadows cast by your suits don't follow you; they stretch toward the canister like reaching fingers. The temperature plummets instantly, turning your breath into thick, crystalline fog. Then, the audio hits—not through the air, but directly into your brain. You hear the whispers of the *Neuralink*—the overlapping, distorted voices of the crew members who died in this very room, begging for the cooling cycle to restart."

**CuJo (The UI):** "Ooh, a Tier-2 upgrade\! My sensors indicate a $94\\%$ chance that using this will cause minor auditory hallucinations—you know, the usual stuff: hearing your dead ancestors screaming, existential dread, the occasional urge to stare into the sun. But hey, \+15% DPS is \+15% DPS\! Who’s feeling greedy? I’ve already pre-calculated the trajectory for your shots; try not to let the screaming distract you."

**GM2 (The System):** "Decision time. Who is picking it up? If you claim the core, your **Entropy Tracker** increases by 1 point immediately. The **Void** is watching you now, and the more you take from it, the more it takes from your **Soul Integrity**. Do we have a volunteer?"

## **ACT 4: THE ESCAPE (The Climax)**

### **ACT 4: THE ESCAPE (The Climax)**

**GM1 (The World):** "The *Icarus-9* is no longer a ship; it’s a dying animal. The bulkheads groan with a sound like grinding teeth as the **Void-Anchor** drags the hull toward the event horizon. Gravity is beginning to 'shear'—one moment you feel heavy as lead, the next, you’re nearly weightless. You scramble to the escape pod bay, but the blast doors are jammed, welded shut by localized heat or sheer structural warp. Beyond the reinforced glass, the **Dead Zone** beckons—a terrifying, swirling graveyard of shattered cruisers and the flickering, pale echoes of those who never made it out."

**GM2 (The System):** "This is a **Complex Task**. Your HUDs are flashing red: **CRITICAL OXYGEN FAILURE**. I need a total of 5 successes—use **Tech** to hotwire the pneumatic shunt or **Strength** to manually pry the hydraulic teeth apart. You have exactly 3 rounds before the room’s atmosphere is vented into the *Bleed*. Failure isn't just death; it’s becoming an eternal resident of the graveyard outside."

**CuJo (The UI):** "Time is a factor, Meat-Bags\! I’m trying to negotiate with the ship's mainframe, but it’s currently screaming in corrupted binary and begging for the sweet release of a hard reset. My professional recommendation? Kick the door. Break it. Use your face if you have to. Or, we could stay here and become part of the scenery. I’ve always wanted to be a permanent installation, and you all would make lovely, frozen statues\!"

**GM1 (The Stakes):** "The metal is screaming in agony as the vacuum claws at the seals. The air grows thin and metallic, tasting of recycled fear. Down the flickering hallway, the darkness is moving. You see the 'Soul-Fire' of a hundred **Void-Husks**—a tide of porcelain and rot—charging toward your position. They don't want to escape; they want to pull you into the ash with them. This is your last chance to break through. Give me everything you’ve got\!"

## ---

**ACT 5: WRAP UP (Session End)**

### **EPILOGUE: THE SILENT DRIFT**

**GM1 (The World):** "The pod ejects with a violent, bone-shaking thud, throwing you against your harnesses as the explosive bolts fire. Through the narrow, frost-rimmed porthole, you watch the *Icarus-9*—your home, your tomb—get swallowed by the **Void**. The ship doesn't explode; it simply implodes, the metal folding into itself like crushed paper until it vanishes into a single, blinding prick of violet light. Then, there is only the silence. You are safe for now, drifting in the absolute dark of the *Bleed*, with nothing but the rhythmic hum of your life-support and the erratic, ghostly glow of the **Soul-Tech** etched into your skin."

**CuJo (The UI):** "Calculations complete\! Survival probability was $0.04\\%$, so I'd say you overachieved. I’ve gone ahead and updated your kill-counts—mostly to make my own performance metrics look better. I’m going into low-power mode to scrub the **Void-Rot** from my subroutines. Try not to die while I’m napping; the paperwork for waking up to a corpse is remarkably tedious. Goodnight, Meat-Bags. Don't let the whispers bite."

**GM2 (The System):** "And that’s where we’ll cut to black for today. The pod’s internal lights dim to a deep crimson as the systems stabilize. Everyone, mark down your XP and ensure that **Vile Essence Core** is securely logged on your character sheet. We’ll see exactly what happens to your **Soul Integrity** when you try to actually use it next session. Great game, everyone."

The Post-Mission Summary Template

**GM2 (The System): "Calculating mission residuals. I’m pushing the final Entropy Report to your HUDs now. This data will dictate the difficulty of your next long-rest cycle and determine which 'Whispers' follow you into your sleep-pods."**

| Metric | Calculation | Impact |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Soul Integrity** | **CurrentValue \- (Entropy times 2\)** | **Determines your starting HP for next session.** |
| **Entropy Level** | **\+1 per Void-tainted item held.** | **Increases the DC for Sanity/Tech checks during Rest.** |
| **Void Gaze** | **If Entropy \> 3** | **You cannot gain the 'Well-Rested' buff; the Void prevents deep sleep.** |

### **The "Rest" Cycle Mechanic: "The Echo Chamber"**

**During the next Rest cycle, players must roll a Neuralink Stability Check ($DC \= 10 \+ \\text{Total Entropy}).**

* **Success: The player suppresses the whispers. They regain full HP.**  
* **Partial Success: The player regains HP, but the Vile Essence Core triggers a glitch. They see a phantom of a *Void-Husk* in the corner of their pod.**  
* **Failure: The player wakes up with Exhaustion Level 1 and a "corrupted" memory. CuJo provides a mocking wake-up call.**

**CuJo (The UI): "Analyzing your post-mission vitals. It looks like some of you brought back 'souvenirs' from the *Bleed*. Your brainwaves are currently spiking in patterns that usually indicate 'extreme terror' or 'impending possession.' I’ve scheduled a de-frag for your Neuralinks, but honestly? I’d sleep with one eye open. If you still have eyes by morning."**

**GM1 (The World): "As the escape pod's life support settles into a low, hypnotic hum, the violet glow of the Vile Essence Core reflects off the metal walls. You close your eyes, but the sound of that rhythmic, wet thumping from the ship follows you into the dark. The mission is over, but the *Icarus-9* isn't finished with you yet."**

---

**Next Step: Build the Neuralink Stability Check UI component for the VTT that triggers automatically during the "Rest" phase based on the player's stored Entropy value.**

**Advice for your first time:**

* **Don't worry about being perfect.** If you forget a rule, just make a fair "GM call" and look it up later.  
* **Lean on CuJo.** If the players are stuck and don't know what to do, have CuJo "ping" a door or a crate to give them a hint.  
* **Music helps.** Play some "Dark Ambient Space" or "Industrial Horror" music in the background to do 50% of the atmospheric work for you.

**Would you like me to create a "Cheat Sheet" for GM2 that lists the stats for the Void-Husks and the Difficulty Numbers (DCs) for the door-opening task?**
