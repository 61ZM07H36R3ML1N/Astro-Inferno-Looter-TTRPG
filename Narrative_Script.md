Astro Inferno GM Script  
To help your Game Master (GM) bridge the gap between your new **Soul-Forge** code and the narrative, here is a "Voice of the Machine" script.

This script is designed to be read aloud when a player clicks the **"Etch Into The Void"** button in your app. It uses the **Origin Powers** and **Truths** you just programmed into the project.

### **🎙️ The Soul-Forge Awakening Script**

**GM (to the player):**

"The interface flickers, cast in the harsh light of the {Origin Power}. As you press your hand against the glass, the Aether Economy recognizes your {Form}. A heavy, metallic voice vibrates through your skull..."

#### **If the Player chose: THE SATANIC COURT**

* **The Voice:** "Blood Tithe accepted. Your {Truth}—that dark history of being a {Truth}—is no longer a memory; it is a debt. We have honed your blades to bite deeper, but beware... the Machine Hunger grows. If you do not feed the void with violence, it will feed on you."  
* **The Mechanical Cue:** "GM Note: Remind them their weapons now deal bonus Melee damage, but their Jam Risk has increased by 10%."

#### **If the Player chose: THE ANCIENTS**

* **The Voice:** "The echoes of the Void-Walker respond. You carry the {Truth} of a {Truth}. Your soul is a relic of a dead star. You will see openings in the enemy’s guard that others cannot, but every strike drains the very Aura that keeps you sane."  
* **The Mechanical Cue:** "GM Note: Their Critical Range is expanded, but warn them about the Aura Drain penalty."

#### **If the Player chose: GENESIS MACHINE**

* **The Voice:** "Calibration complete. Protocol: {Truth} active. You are a precision tool in a world of scrap. Your aim will be flawless, your math perfect. But remember, little machine: perfection generates heat. Push too hard, and you will melt from the inside out."  
* **The Mechanical Cue:** "GM Note: Give them their Accuracy bonus, but keep a close eye on their Overheat Risk."

#### **If the Player chose: SECULAR (The Vault Survivor)**

* **The Voice:** "Scanning... No divine signature found. You are a ghost in the system, a {Truth} surviving on grit and scavenged luck. You find what others miss, but your gear is as broken as the world you inhabit. Keep it together, scavenger."  
* **The Mechanical Cue:** "GM Note: Boost their Scavenge Luck rolls, but remind them their gear has the 'Fragile' tag."
